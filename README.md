______PROJECT_____
This Project is a showcase of my Front-end development skiils. The site uses html,JavaScript and css tailwind. It is highly responsive and easy to navigate on all screen types.

_______DIFFICULTIES______
None, i had adequate time to find all the information where i lacked.

_____REFLECTIONS_______
It is much easier and quicker to style using tailwind. it will be my go to choice when i have a front end job.

______FEEDBACK_____
I found this challange empowering. It made me understand layouts and containers better.
In future I intend to use more tailwind, but not neglecting css.
